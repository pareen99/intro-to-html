       <p>My favourite activites are usually art related. I like to sketch outfits and put together collections. I like taking walks on campus because there's something very calming about all the trees and greenery. Specifically during this pandemic I like to find outfits on pinterest that I will wear once I have places to go. I love reading too and lately I've become very intrgued by non-fictional books which my fourteen year old self would scowl at.</p>
